### QUESTION: Is there atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) directly mentioned in this report? 

### INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Firstly, think whether there are any direct mentions of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) in the report. Remember that any uncertain, suggestive, or possible language about atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) should also be treated as a direct mention.
2. Then, if there IS direct mention, **you must carefully consider the context of which it is placed**: does it suggest a positive or negative diagnosis? Does it suggest that the condition is resolved or no longer present?
3. Next, give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung), carefully considering the assumptions below. Give these reasons headings 'TOP REASON FOR' and 'TOP REASON AGAINST'. Carefully consider any context or change in conditions.

* Assume that any severity of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) indicates that it is directly mentioned and your probability MUST be stricly greater than 50%.
* If there is no direct mention of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung), your probability MUST be strictly less than 50%.
* Assume any direct mention of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) including uncertain, suggestive or possible language as a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS, where your probability must be greater than 50%.
* MOST IMPORTANT: Opacity, consolidation, pneumonia or any other disorders do NOT imply the presence or diagnosis of atelectasis. Only direct and explicit mention of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) (including uncertainty) warrants a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS with a probability greater than 50%.
* If the condition is resolved, then you can assume this to be a NEGATIVE DIAGNOSIS.

The report mentions ""asymmetric opacification involving the right hemithorax"", but it does not directly mention consolidation. Therefore, there is no direct mention of consolidation in this report.

2. Since there is no direct mention of consolidation, we can conclude that the probability of consolidation being present is less than 50%.

3. The top reason for a positive diagnosis of consolidation is the presence of asymmetric opacification involving the right hemithorax, which could potentially be related to consolidation. However, this is not a direct mention of consolidation, and the report does not provide any further information to support this hypothesis.

The top reason against a positive diagnosis of consolidation is the lack of any direct mention of consolidation in the report. The report does not explicitly state that consolidation is present, and therefore, it is not possible to make a positive diagnosis based on the information provided.

4. Based on the information provided in the report, it is not possible to make a positive diagnosis of consolidation. The presence of asymmetric opacification involving the right hemithorax does not provide enough information to support a positive diagnosis of consolidation, and the lack of any direct mention of consolidation makes it unlikely that consolidation is present.

Give these reasons headings 'TOP REASON FOR' and 'TOP REASON AGAINST'. Carefully consider any context or change in conditions.
4. After this, give a final concise conclusion including a definitive answer to the question with a probability that a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) is present, following the assumptions.
5. Finally, output this sentence in this exact format (so that I can automatically parse your answer for your probability), inserting your probability: ""Probability of a nodule present: <INSERT_YOUR_PROBABILITY>%."". Your probability must NOT be exactly 50%.

### ASSUMPTIONS:
* Assume that any severity of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) indicates that it is directly mentioned and your probability MUST be stricly greater than 50%.
* If there is no direct mention of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease), your probability MUST be strictly less than 50%.
* Assume any direct mention of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) including uncertain, suggestive or possible language as a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS, where your probability must be greater than 50%.
* MOST IMPORTANT:Sarcoidosis, opacities, densities or any other disorders do NOT imply the presence or diagnosis of a nodule. Only direct and explicit mention of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) (including uncertainty) warrants a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS with a probability greater than 50%.
* If the condition is resolved, then you can assume this to be a NEGATIVE DIAGNOSIS.

### REPORT: No significant change since ___. A moderate right pleural effusion and asymmetric opacification involving the right hemithorax is likely related to progressive changes related to her known disease process/and or a component of asymmetric edema.

The report does not directly mention pneumothorax.

2. Since there is no direct mention of pneumothorax, we can assume that the probability of pneumothorax being present is less than 50%.

3. Now, let's provide a top reason for and against a current positive diagnosis of pneumothorax:

TOP REASON FOR:
There is no direct mention of pneumothorax in the report, so there is no reason to suspect a positive diagnosis of pneumothorax.

TOP REASON AGAINST:
The report does not mention pneumothorax, so there is no reason to suspect a positive diagnosis of pneumothorax.

4. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that:

There is no direct mention of pneumothorax in the report, so the probability of pneumothorax being present is less than 50%.

5. Finally, we can output the following sentence:

""Probability of pneumothorax present: 0%.""

The report mentions ""asymmetric opacification involving the right hemithorax is likely related to progressive changes related to her known disease process/and or a component of asymmetric edema.""

So, there is a direct mention of edema (including vascular congestion) in the report.

2. Next, let's consider the context of which it is placed:

The report suggests that the edema is related to the patient's known disease process and is likely progressive.

3. Now, let's give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of edema (including vascular congestion):

TOP REASON FOR: The report explicitly mentions ""asymmetric edema"" as a possible cause of the patient's condition.

TOP REASON AGAINST: There is no clear indication of the severity or extent of the edema, and the report only suggests that it is ""likely related"" to the patient's known disease process.
