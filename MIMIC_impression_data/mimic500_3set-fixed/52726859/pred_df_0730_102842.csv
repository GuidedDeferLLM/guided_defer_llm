1. Firstly, think whether there are any direct mentions of pneumothorax in the report. Remember that any uncertain, suggestive, or possible language about pneumothorax should also be treated as a direct mention.
2. Then, if there IS direct mention, **you must carefully consider the context of which it is placed**: does it suggest a positive or negative diagnosis? Does it suggest that the condition is resolved or no longer present?
3. Next, give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of pneumothorax, carefully considering the assumptions below. Give these reasons headings 'TOP REASON FOR' and 'TOP REASON AGAINST'. Carefully consider any context or change in conditions.
4. After this, give a final concise conclusion including a definitive answer to the question with a probability that pneumothorax is present, following the assumptions.
5. Finally, output this sentence in this exact format (so that I can automatically parse your answer for your probability), inserting your probability: ""Probability of pneumothorax present: <INSERT_YOUR_PROBABILITY>%."". Your probability must NOT be exactly 50%.

### ASSUMPTIONS:
* Assume that any severity of pneumothorax indicates that it is directly mentioned and your probability MUST be stricly greater than 50%.
* If there is no direct mention of pneumothorax, your probability MUST be strictly less than 50%.
* Assume any direct mention of pneumothorax including uncertain, suggestive or possible language as a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS, where your probability must be greater than 50%.
* MOST IMPORTANT: Only direct and explicit mention of pneumothorax (including uncertainty) warrants a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS with a probability greater than 50%.
* If the condition is resolved, then you can assume this to be a NEGATIVE DIAGNOSIS.

### REPORT: Status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement, newly implanted permanent pacer, unremarkable position of electrode termination and no pneumothorax.

1. Firstly, let's think step-by-step if there's any direct mention of pneumothorax in the report, carefully considering the above assumptions:

The report states ""no pneumothorax."" This is a direct mention of pneumothorax, and it suggests a negative diagnosis.

2. Next, let's give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of pneumothorax:

TOP REASON FOR: There is a direct mention of pneumothorax, which indicates that it is being ruled out as a possibility.

TOP REASON AGAINST: The report explicitly states ""no pneumothorax,"" which suggests a negative diagnosis.

3. After this, let's give a final concise conclusion including a definitive answer to the question with a probability that pneumothorax is present, following the assumptions:

Based on the report, it is clear that pneumothorax is not present, as it explicitly states ""no pneumothorax.""

4. Finally, let's output the sentence in the required format:

""Probability of pneumothorax present: 0%.""

The probability of pneumothorax being present is 0%, as the report explicitly states that there is no pneumothorax.</s>",0.0,"
There is no direct mention of edema (including vascular congestion) in the report.

2. Next, let's give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of edema (including vascular congestion), carefully considering the assumptions below:

TOP REASON FOR:
There is no direct mention of edema (including vascular congestion) in the report.

TOP REASON AGAINST:
There is no direct mention of edema (including vascular congestion) in the report.

3. After this, let's give a final concise conclusion including a definitive answer to the question with a probability that edema (including vascular congestion) is present, following the assumptions:

There is no direct mention of edema (including vascular congestion) in the report. Therefore, the probability of an edema present is less than 50%.

4. Finally, let's output the sentence in the required format:

### QUESTION: Is there edema (including vascular congestion) directly mentioned in this report? 

### INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Firstly, think whether there are any direct mentions of edema (including vascular congestion) in the report. **Do NOT consider a pulmonary effusion as a pulmonary edema diagnosis**. Remember that any uncertain, suggestive, or possible language about edema (including vascular congestion) should also be treated as a direct mention.
2. Then, if there IS direct mention, **you must carefully consider the context of which it is placed**: does it suggest a positive or negative diagnosis? Does it suggest that the condition is resolved or no longer present?
3. Next, give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of edema (including vascular congestion), carefully considering the assumptions below. Give these reasons headings 'TOP REASON FOR' and 'TOP REASON AGAINST'. Carefully consider any context or change in conditions.

5. Finally, output this sentence in this exact format (so that I can automatically parse your answer for your probability), inserting your probability: ""Probability of an edema present: <INSERT_YOUR_PROBABILITY>%."". Your probability must NOT be exactly 50%.

* If there is no direct mention of edema (including vascular congestion), your probability MUST be strictly less than 50%.
* Assume any direct mention of edema (including vascular congestion) including uncertain, suggestive or possible language as a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS, where your probability must be greater than 50%.
* MOST IMPORTANT: Pleural effusion or any other disorders do NOT imply the presence or diagnosis of a pulmonary edema. Only direct and explicit mention of edema (including vascular congestion) (including uncertainty) warrants a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS with a probability greater than 50%.
* If the condition is resolved, then you can assume this to be a NEGATIVE DIAGNOSIS.

There is no direct mention of widened mediastinal silhouette (including any mentions of cardiomegaly or an enlarged cardiomediastinum) in the report.

2. Since there is no direct mention, we can conclude that there is no positive diagnosis of widened mediastinal silhouette (including any mentions of cardiomegaly or an enlarged cardiomediastinum).

TOP REASON FOR: There is no direct mention of widened mediastinal silhouette (including any mentions of cardiomegaly or an enlarged cardiomediastinum) in the report.

TOP REASON AGAINST: There is no direct mention of widened mediastinal silhouette (including any mentions of cardiomegaly or an enlarged cardiomediastinum) in the report.

3. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that there is no positive diagnosis of widened mediastinal silhouette (including any mentions of cardiomegaly or an enlarged cardiomediastinum).

Conclusion: There is no positive diagnosis of widened mediastinal silhouette (including any mentions of cardiomegaly or an enlarged cardiomediastinum) in the report.
