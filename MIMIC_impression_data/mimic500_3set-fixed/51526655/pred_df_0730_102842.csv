1. Firstly, think whether there are any direct mentions of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) in the report. Remember that any uncertain, suggestive, or possible language about atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) should also be treated as a direct mention.
2. Then, if there IS direct mention, **you must carefully consider the context of which it is placed**: does it suggest a positive or negative diagnosis? Does it suggest that the condition is resolved or no longer present?
3. Next, give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung), carefully considering the assumptions below. Give these reasons headings 'TOP REASON FOR' and 'TOP REASON AGAINST'. Carefully consider any context or change in conditions.

* MOST IMPORTANT: Opacity, consolidation, pneumonia or any other disorders do NOT imply the presence or diagnosis of atelectasis. Only direct and explicit mention of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) (including uncertainty) warrants a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS with a probability greater than 50%.

### REPORT: The course of the chest tube projecting over the right chest suggests an intrafissural position, which may limit the ability to evacuate the pneumothorax. A visceral pleural line remains evident and most apparent at the lung base with an extension of the air to the spinal hardware as noted on the CT earlier today. Widespread metastatic disease of the lungs is again seen. There is no radiographic evidence currently of tension physiology.

1. Firstly, let's think step-by-step if there's any direct mention of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) in the report, carefully considering the above assumptions:

The report mentions ""widespread metastatic disease of the lungs is again seen."" This is a direct mention of metastatic disease, which is a type of nodule.

2. Next, let's consider the context of the direct mention:

The report does not suggest a positive or negative diagnosis of the metastatic disease. It simply states that it is present.

3. Now, let's give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease):

TOP REASON FOR: The report directly mentions ""widespread metastatic disease of the lungs is again seen."" This is a clear positive diagnosis of a nodule (metastatic disease).

TOP REASON AGAINST: There is no reason against a positive diagnosis of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) in this report.

4. Based on the above, let's give a final concise conclusion including a definitive answer to the question with a probability that a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) is present:

There is a direct mention of a nodule (metastatic disease) in the report, and it is not suggested to be resolved. Therefore, the probability of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) being present is 90%.

5. Finally, let's output the sentence in the required format:

""Probability of a nodule present: 90%.""</s>",80.0,"
The report mentions ""the ability to evacuate the pneumothorax"" and ""radiographic evidence currently of tension physiology."" This suggests that there is a pneumothorax present, and it is being monitored for tension physiology.

2. Next, let's give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of pneumothorax:

TOP REASON FOR: The report mentions ""the ability to evacuate the pneumothorax"" and ""radiographic evidence currently of tension physiology,"" which suggests that there is a pneumothorax present.

TOP REASON AGAINST: There is no explicit mention of the pneumothorax being resolved or no longer present.

3. After this, let's give a final concise conclusion including a definitive answer to the question with a probability that pneumothorax is present:

Based on the report, there is a direct mention of pneumothorax, and it is being monitored for tension physiology. Therefore, the probability of pneumothorax being present is greater than 50%.

4. Finally, let's output the sentence in the required format:

""Probability of pneumothorax present: 80%.""

### QUESTION: Is there pneumothorax directly mentioned in this report? 

### INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Firstly, think whether there are any direct mentions of pneumothorax in the report. Remember that any uncertain, suggestive, or possible language about pneumothorax should also be treated as a direct mention.
2. Then, if there IS direct mention, **you must carefully consider the context of which it is placed**: does it suggest a positive or negative diagnosis? Does it suggest that the condition is resolved or no longer present?
3. Next, give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of pneumothorax, carefully considering the assumptions below. Give these reasons headings 'TOP REASON FOR' and 'TOP REASON AGAINST'. Carefully consider any context or change in conditions.
4. After this, give a final concise conclusion including a definitive answer to the question with a probability that pneumothorax is present, following the assumptions.
5. Finally, output this sentence in this exact format (so that I can automatically parse your answer for your probability), inserting your probability: ""Probability of pneumothorax present: <INSERT_YOUR_PROBABILITY>%."". Your probability must NOT be exactly 50%.

### ASSUMPTIONS:
* Assume that any severity of pneumothorax indicates that it is directly mentioned and your probability MUST be stricly greater than 50%.
