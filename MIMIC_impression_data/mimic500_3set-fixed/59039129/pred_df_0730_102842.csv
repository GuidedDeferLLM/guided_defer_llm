1. Firstly, think whether there are any direct mentions of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) in the report. Remember that any uncertain, suggestive, or possible language about atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) should also be treated as a direct mention.
2. Then, if there IS direct mention, **you must carefully consider the context of which it is placed**: does it suggest a positive or negative diagnosis? Does it suggest that the condition is resolved or no longer present?
3. Next, give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung), carefully considering the assumptions below. Give these reasons headings 'TOP REASON FOR' and 'TOP REASON AGAINST'. Carefully consider any context or change in conditions.

Only direct and explicit mention of atelectasis (a collapse of an area of the lung) (including uncertainty) warrants a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS with a probability greater than 50%.
* If the condition is resolved, then you can assume this to be a NEGATIVE DIAGNOSIS.

Firstly, think whether there are any direct mentions of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) in the report**Do NOT consider sarcoidosis, lung opacities or densities as a nodule diagnosis**. Remember that any uncertain, suggestive, or possible language about a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) should also be treated as a direct mention.
2. Then, if there IS direct mention, **you must carefully consider the context of which it is placed**: does it suggest a positive or negative diagnosis? Does it suggest that the condition is resolved or no longer present?
3. Next, give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease), carefully considering the assumptions below. Give these reasons headings 'TOP REASON FOR' and 'TOP REASON AGAINST'. Carefully consider any context or change in conditions.
4. After this, give a final concise conclusion including a definitive answer to the question with a probability that a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) is present, following the assumptions.
5. Finally, output this sentence in this exact format (so that I can automatically parse your answer for your probability), inserting your probability: ""Probability of a nodule present: <INSERT_YOUR_PROBABILITY>%."". Your probability must NOT be exactly 50%.

### ASSUMPTIONS:
* Assume that any severity of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) indicates that it is directly mentioned and your probability MUST be stricly greater than 50%.
* If there is no direct mention of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease), your probability MUST be strictly less than 50%.
* Assume any direct mention of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) including uncertain, suggestive or possible language as a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS, where your probability must be greater than 50%.
* MOST IMPORTANT:Sarcoidosis, opacities, densities or any other disorders do NOT imply the presence or diagnosis of a nodule. Only direct and explicit mention of a nodule (including masses, granulomas and metastatic disease) (including uncertainty) warrants a POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS with a probability greater than 50%.
* If the condition is resolved, then you can assume this to be a NEGATIVE DIAGNOSIS.

### REPORT: Interval increase/development of bilateral, right greater than left, pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Right base opacity may be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, however, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.

The report mentions ""minimal pulmonary vascular congestion"". This is a direct mention of vascular congestion.

2. Next, let's consider the context of the direct mention:

The report states ""minimal pulmonary vascular congestion"". This suggests a positive diagnosis of vascular congestion, but it is described as minimal.

3. Now, let's give a brief and concise single top reason both for and against a current POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS of edema (including vascular congestion):

TOP REASON FOR: The report directly mentions ""minimal pulmonary vascular congestion"", which suggests a positive diagnosis of vascular congestion.
